7.Suppose, you owe the credit card company $1000.00. The company charges you
1.5% per month on the unpaid balance. You have decided to stop using the card and to
pay off the debt by making a monthly payment of N dollars a month. Write a program
that asks for the monthly payment and then write out the balance and total payments
received so far for every succeeding month until the balance is zero or less. 

 	package testing;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CreditCardPayment {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	char userinput;
    
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        do {
        System.out.println("Enter the monthly payment:");
        double monthlyPayment = scanner.nextDouble();

        double balance = 1000.0;
        double interestRate = 0.015;
        double totalPayments = 0.0;
        int month = 1;

        while (balance > 0) {
            double interest = balance * interestRate;
            balance = balance + interest - monthlyPayment;

            // Avoid negative balance
            if (balance < 0) {
                balance = 0;
            }

            totalPayments += monthlyPayment;

            System.out.printf("Month %d: balance: %.6f total payments: %.2f%n", month, balance, totalPayments);

            month++;
        }
        System.out.println("Do you want to execute again (y/n) ? :");
        userinput =scanner. next().charAt(0);
        
    }while(userinput == 'Y' || userinput == 'y');
        scanner.close();
}
}


OUTPUT:

Enter the monthly payment:
100
Month 1: balance: 915.000000 total payments: 100.00
Month 2: balance: 828.725000 total payments: 200.00
Month 3: balance: 741.155875 total payments: 300.00
Month 4: balance: 652.273213 total payments: 400.00
Month 5: balance: 562.057311 total payments: 500.00
Month 6: balance: 470.488171 total payments: 600.00
Month 7: balance: 377.545494 total payments: 700.00
Month 8: balance: 283.208676 total payments: 800.00
Month 9: balance: 187.456806 total payments: 900.00
Month 10: balance: 90.268658 total payments: 1000.00
Month 11: balance: 0.000000 total payments: 1100.00
Do you want to execute again (y/n) ? :


4.Write a program to test socket functionality for appropriate hostname and port number.

package testing;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketTester {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String hostname = "example.com"; // Replace with your hostname
        int port = 80; // Replace with your port number

        testSocketConnection(hostname, port);
    }

    private static void testSocketConnection(String hostname, int port) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Attempting to connect to " + hostname + " on port " + port);
            Socket socket = new Socket(hostname, port);
            
            // If the connection is successful, the following line will be reached
            System.out.println("Connection successful!");

            // Close the socket after testing
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Connection failed. Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}



OUTPUT:

Attempting to connect to example.com on port 80
Connection successful!

5.Write a program for client and server chatting if client requests server for arithmetic
operation like add, subtract, and multiplication then server perform all the above
mentioned operations


package testing;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
