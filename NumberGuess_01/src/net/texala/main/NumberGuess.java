 DAY : 7
 ASSIGNMENT NO : 1 
  
Write a program called NumberGuess to play the number guessing game.
The program should generate a random number between 0 to 99. The player
inputs her/his guess and the program shall respond with Try higher, Try
lower or You got it in n trials accordingly. For example,
> Java NumberGuess
Key in your guess:
50
Try higher
70
Try lower
65
Try lower
"
You got it in 4 trials!
