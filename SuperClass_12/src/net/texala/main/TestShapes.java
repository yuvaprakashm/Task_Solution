/*

DAY : 10
ASSIGNMENT NO : 12

Write a superclass called Shape (as shown in the class diagram above), which
contains the following.
·Two instance variables color (String) and filled (boolean).
·Two constructors: a no-arg (no-argument) constructor that initializes the
color to green and filled to true, and a constructor that initializes the
color and filled to the given values.
·Getter and setter for all the instance variables. By convention, the getter for a
boolean variable xxx is called isXXX() (instead of getXxx() for all the
other types).
·A toString() method that returns A Shape with color of xxx and
filled/Not filled.
·Write a test program to test all the methods defined in Shape.
