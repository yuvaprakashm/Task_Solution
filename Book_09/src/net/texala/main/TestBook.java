Book and Author Classes (to be used once more) - A Fixed-length Array
of Objects as an Instance Variable. In the above exercise, the number of authors cannot be changed once a Book instance is
constructed. Suppose that we wish to allow the user to add more authors (which is really
unusual but presented here for academic purpose).
We shall remove the authors from the constructors, and add a new method called
addAuthor() to add the given Author instance to this Book.
We also need to pre-allocate an Author array, with a fixed length (says 5 - a book is written
by 1 to 5 authors), and use another instance variable numAuthors (int) to keep track of
the actual number of authors.
